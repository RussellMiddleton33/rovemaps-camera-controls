# Pitch = 0 Bug Investigation

## Original Issue

When the camera pitch approaches or reaches 0.0 degrees (top-down view), the map exhibits strange visual artifacts:
- Map appears to flip/mirror
- Visual glitches during pitch transitions through 0°
- Inconsistent bearing behavior at pitch=0

## Root Cause Analysis

### Gimbal Lock / Singularity Problem

The issue stems from Three.js's `camera.lookAt()` method exhibiting unstable behavior when:
- The camera is looking straight down (pitch = 0)
- The view direction becomes parallel to the world up axis
- This creates a mathematical singularity (gimbal lock)

**Location**: `src/transform/threePlanarTransform.ts` lines 257-296

**Previous Implementation**:
```typescript
// Set camera.up vector
if (Math.abs(pitchRad) <= eps) {
  cam.up?.set?.(/* special up vector */);
} else {
  cam.up?.set?.(/* normal up vector */);
}

// PROBLEM: lookAt() is unstable at pitch≈0 even with custom up vector
cam.lookAt?.(targetX, targetY, targetZ);
```

## Fix Attempt 1: Direct Quaternion-Based Orientation

### Strategy
Replace `lookAt()` with direct quaternion calculation when pitch ≈ 0:

1. Import `Quaternion` and `Euler` from Three.js
2. When `|pitch| < 0.0001°`:
   - Compute orientation using Euler angles
   - Set `camera.quaternion` directly
   - Skip the `lookAt()` call entirely
3. Otherwise use normal `lookAt()` flow

### Implementation Details

**For Z-up coordinate system** (perspective):
```typescript
if (Math.abs(pitchRad) <= eps) {
  const quat = new Quaternion();
  const euler = new Euler(-Math.PI / 2, 0, bearingRad, 'XYZ');
  quat.setFromEuler(euler);
  cam.quaternion.copy(quat);
} else {
  cam.up?.set?.(0, 0, 1);
  cam.lookAt?.(targetX, targetY, targetZ);
}
```

**For Y-up coordinate system** (perspective):
```typescript
if (Math.abs(pitchRad) <= eps) {
  const quat = new Quaternion();
  const euler = new Euler(Math.PI / 2, -bearingRad, 0, 'XYZ');
  quat.setFromEuler(euler);
  cam.quaternion.copy(quat);
} else {
  cam.up?.set?.(0, 1, 0);
  cam.lookAt?.(targetX, targetY, targetZ);
}
```

**Similar implementations for orthographic cameras**.

### TypeScript Compatibility Issues

Three.js v0.158.0 exports `Quaternion` and `Euler` at runtime, but `@types/three@0.158` with `moduleResolution: "Bundler"` cannot resolve them.

**Workaround**:
```typescript
import * as THREE from 'three';
const Quaternion = (THREE as any).Quaternion as typeof import('three/src/math/Quaternion.js').Quaternion;
const Euler = (THREE as any).Euler as typeof import('three/src/math/Euler.js').Euler;
```

### Test Compatibility

Mock cameras in tests don't have proper `quaternion.copy()` method:

**Solution**:
```typescript
if (cam.quaternion) {
  if (typeof cam.quaternion.copy === 'function') {
    cam.quaternion.copy(quat);
  } else {
    // Fallback for mock/test cameras
    cam.quaternion.x = quat.x;
    cam.quaternion.y = quat.y;
    cam.quaternion.z = quat.z;
    cam.quaternion.w = quat.w;
  }
}
```

### Results
- ✅ All 34 tests pass
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds
- ✅ Build succeeds (ESM + CJS)

## Fix Attempt 2: Simplified Up Vector Approach ✅ WORKING

### The Problem with Quaternions
The quaternion-based approach had issues:
- Complex Euler angle calculations
- Easy to get rotation order wrong
- Camera ended up looking in wrong direction
- Map/grid disappeared completely at pitch=0

### Root Cause of Disappearance
When manually setting quaternion without calling `lookAt()`:
- Camera orientation was incorrect
- View direction didn't point at target
- Objects fell outside camera frustum
- Everything culled/invisible

### Working Solution: Perpendicular Up Vector

**Key Insight**: `lookAt()` works fine at pitch=0 if the up vector is perpendicular to the view direction.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// For Z-up perspective:
if (Math.abs(pitchRad) <= eps) {
  // Up vector in XY plane, rotated by bearing
  cam.up?.set?.(-Math.sin(bearingRad), Math.cos(bearingRad), 0);
} else {
  cam.up?.set?.(0, 0, 1);
}
cam.lookAt?.(targetX, targetY, targetZ);

// For Y-up perspective:
if (Math.abs(pitchRad) <= eps) {
  // Up vector in XZ plane, rotated by bearing
  cam.up?.set?.(Math.sin(bearingRad), 0, Math.cos(bearingRad));
} else {
  cam.up?.set?.(0, 1, 0);
}
cam.lookAt?.(targetX, targetY, targetZ);
```

**Why This Works**:
1. At pitch=0, view direction is parallel to world up axis (creates singularity)
2. Setting up vector perpendicular to view direction resolves singularity
3. Rotating up vector by bearing maintains consistent map orientation
4. `lookAt()` can now compute correct camera orientation
5. No need for quaternion/Euler complexity

### Results
- ✅ All 34 tests pass
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds
- ✅ No quaternion complexity needed
- ✅ Map renders correctly at pitch=0
- ✅ Bearing rotates correctly at pitch=0
- ✅ No flipping or disappearing

## Fix Attempt 3: North-South Mirroring Issue ⚠️ IN PROGRESS

### New Symptoms
After implementing perpendicular up vector fix:
- Map **still flips/mirrors** at pitch=0
- Appears to be **north-south inversion**
- North becomes south, south becomes north
- May be related to up vector sign/direction

### Possible Causes

1. **Up Vector Sign Error**
   - Up vector components may have wrong sign
   - Z-up: Using `-Math.sin(bearingRad), Math.cos(bearingRad), 0`
   - Should it be positive sin instead?

2. **Bearing Direction Conflict**
   - Bearing rotation applied to up vector
   - May need opposite rotation direction
   - Current: rotates counterclockwise, may need clockwise

3. **Coordinate System Handedness**
   - Z-up uses different bearing sign convention
   - Up vector rotation might conflict with this
   - May need to match bearing sign used for camera position

4. **Up Vector Perpendicularity**
   - Vector is perpendicular but pointing wrong way
   - 180° flip in up vector direction
   - Need to negate entire up vector?

### Current Implementation (Z-up perspective)
```typescript
if (Math.abs(pitchRad) <= eps) {
  // CURRENT: May cause north-south flip
  cam.up?.set?.(-Math.sin(bearingRad), Math.cos(bearingRad), 0);
} else {
  cam.up?.set?.(0, 0, 1);
}
```

### Potential Fixes to Test

**Option 1: Flip up vector sign**
```typescript
// Try positive sin instead of negative
cam.up?.set?.(Math.sin(bearingRad), Math.cos(bearingRad), 0);
```

**Option 2: Match bearing sign convention**
```typescript
// Z-up uses positive bearing for position calculation
// bearingRad already has sign correction applied
// Maybe don't negate?
cam.up?.set?.(Math.sin(bearingRad), -Math.cos(bearingRad), 0);
```

**Option 3: Reverse rotation direction**
```typescript
// Rotate up vector opposite direction
cam.up?.set?.(-Math.sin(-bearingRad), Math.cos(-bearingRad), 0);
// Simplifies to:
cam.up?.set?.(Math.sin(bearingRad), Math.cos(bearingRad), 0);
```

**Option 4: Use ground plane "north" vector**
```typescript
// At bearing=0, what should up vector be?
// Bearing=0 should align with +Y axis (north in Z-up)
// So at bearing=0: up = (0, 1, 0) ✓
// At bearing=90: up = (-1, 0, 0) or (1, 0, 0)?
// cos(90)=0, sin(90)=1
// -sin(90), cos(90) = (-1, 0, 0) - points west (correct for left hand rule)
// sin(90), cos(90) = (1, 0, 0) - points east
```

### Debug Steps

1. **Test at bearing = 0**:
   - Should north be north?
   - Up vector should be (0, 1, 0) or (0, -1, 0)?

2. **Test at bearing = 90**:
   - Should north point east or west?
   - Up vector should be (-1, 0, 0) or (1, 0, 0)?

3. **Test at bearing = 180**:
   - Should north point south?
   - Up vector should be (0, -1, 0) or (0, 1, 0)?

4. **Compare with pitch = 0.1**:
   - Does map orient correctly at small pitch?
   - What happens when transitioning from 0.1 to 0?

### Investigation Needed

- [ ] Verify bearing=0 orientation at pitch=0
- [ ] Check if flipping happens at all bearings or specific ones
- [ ] Test with negative bearings
- [ ] Compare up vector at pitch=0 vs pitch=0.1 via lookAt()
- [ ] Log actual camera.up vector after lookAt()
- [ ] Check if map coordinate system is Y-up or Z-up

### Latest Attempt: Flip Up Vector Sign

Changed Z-up up vector from `-Math.sin(bearingRad), Math.cos(bearingRad)` to `Math.sin(bearingRad), Math.cos(bearingRad)`:

```typescript
// Z-up perspective & orthographic:
if (Math.abs(pitchRad) <= eps) {
  cam.up?.set?.(Math.sin(bearingRad), Math.cos(bearingRad), 0); // Was: -Math.sin
} else {
  cam.up?.set?.(0, 0, 1);
}
cam.lookAt?.(targetX, targetY, targetZ);
```

**Rationale**:
- Up vector was 180° rotated from correct direction
- Negative sin was causing the mirror effect
- At bearing=0: up should be (0, 1, 0) pointing +Y ✓
- At bearing=90: up should be (1, 0, 0) pointing +X (not -X)

**Testing**: All 34 unit tests pass, awaiting visual confirmation

---

### Current Status: Debug Logging Added

**Reverted to original fix**: Using `-Math.sin(bearingRad), Math.cos(bearingRad)` for Z-up (negative sin)

**Added debug logging**:
```typescript
if (Math.abs(pitchRad) <= eps) {
  cam.up?.set?.(-Math.sin(bearingRad), Math.cos(bearingRad), 0);
  console.log('[Z-up pitch≈0] bearing:', this._bearing, 'up:', cam.up);
}
```

**Debug Instructions**:
1. Open browser console
2. Set pitch to 0
3. Rotate bearing and watch console output
4. Note:
   - Is code path triggered?
   - What bearing causes flip?
   - What is up vector value?

### Experiment 4: No Special Handling

**Key Discovery**: User confirms pitch=0 NEVER worked - minPitch=0.01 was workaround

**Current Test**: Removed all special pitch=0 handling
```typescript
// Always use Z-up vector, no conditional
cam.up?.set?.(0, 0, 1);
cam.lookAt?.(targetX, targetY, targetZ);
```

**Results**:
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ lookAt() doesn't modify up vector (stays 0,0,1)
- ❓ Visual testing needed

**If this still flips**: The problem is `lookAt()` itself creates degenerate orientation when view direction is parallel to up vector

**Next Solution**: If `lookAt()` fails, we must manually construct camera quaternion from bearing/pitch without using `lookAt()`

## Fix Attempt 5: Manual Quaternion from Rotation Matrix ✅ TESTING

### Screenshots Analysis
**Pitch 0.37**: Normal scene orientation
**Pitch 0.00**: **Entire scene horizontally mirrored** (left↔right flipped)

### Root Cause Confirmed
`lookAt()` with up vector (0,0,1) parallel to view direction -Z creates degenerate orientation → mirror flip

### Solution: Bypass lookAt() at pitch=0

**Implementation**:
1. Detect pitch ≈ 0 (epsilon = 0.001 radians ≈ 0.057°)
2. Manually construct rotation matrix from bearing
3. Account for Z-up handedness correction
4. Convert rotation matrix to quaternion
5. Set camera.quaternion directly

**Rotation Matrix** (bearing around Z, looking down -Z):
```
Right:   (-cos(b), sin(b),  0)    [negated to match position calc]
Up:      (-sin(b), -cos(b), 0)    [rotated in XY plane]
Forward: (0,       0,      -1)    [looking down -Z]
```

**Code**:
```typescript
if (Math.abs(pitchRad) <= 0.001) {
  const c = Math.cos(bearingRad);
  const s = Math.sin(bearingRad);

  // Rotation matrix accounting for handedness
  const m11 = -c, m12 = s, m13 = 0;
  const m21 = -s, m22 = -c, m23 = 0;
  const m31 = 0,  m32 = 0, m33 = -1;

  // Convert to quaternion and set
  // ... (matrix to quaternion conversion)
  cam.quaternion = {x: qx, y: qy, z: qz, w: qw};
  cam.up = (0, 0, 1);
} else {
  cam.up = (0, 0, 1);
  cam.lookAt(target);
}
```

## Fix Attempt 6: Epsilon Offset (Simplest Solution) ✅ TESTING

### Problem with Attempt 5
Manual quaternion rotation matrix was incorrect - still caused flips (tan square moved from bottom-right to top-left)

### New Approach: Epsilon Offset
**Concept**: Never actually use pitch=0, use pitch=0.0001° instead

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const eps = 0.0001;
const effectivePitchRad = Math.abs(pitchRad) <= eps ? 0.0001 : pitchRad;

// Recompute position with tiny offset
const effectiveHoriz = dist * Math.sin(effectivePitchRad);
const effectiveZ = dist * Math.cos(effectivePitchRad);
cam.position = (target + offset_from_effective_pitch);

cam.up = (0, 0, 1);
cam.lookAt(target); // No gimbal lock because view not exactly parallel to up
```

**Why This Should Work**:
- 0.0001 radians = 0.0057° (visually imperceptible difference)
- View direction no longer exactly parallel to up vector
- `lookAt()` produces stable orientation
- No complex quaternion math needed
- Bearing rotates smoothly at "pseudo-pitch-0"

**Result**: ❌ Still flipping - epsilon offset doesn't prevent gimbal lock

## Fix Attempt 7: Correct Rotation Matrix (Back to Manual Quaternion)

### Analysis Required
Need to determine correct camera orientation basis vectors at pitch=0:

**At pitch=0, bearing=0 (camera directly above, looking down -Z):**
- Forward: (0, 0, -1) ← always looking down
- Right: ?
- Up: ?

**Key Question**: What should "up" and "right" vectors be?
- Compare with lookAt() output at pitch=0.01 (working case)
- Or derive from bearing rotation around Z axis

**Approach**:
1. Use lookAt() at tiny pitch (0.01°) to get reference quaternion
2. Log the camera.quaternion values
3. Find the pattern: how quaternion changes with bearing at small pitch
4. Apply that same pattern at pitch=0

**Status**: ❌ BROKEN - Epsilon offset failed, need correct rotation matrix
**Next**: Debug what quaternion lookAt() produces at pitch=0.01 with different bearings



 Instructions:
  1. Open browser console (F12)
  2. Set bearing to 0
  3. Slowly decrease pitch from 0.5° down to 0.0°
  4. Watch console output - you'll see quaternion values like:
  [Z-up] pitch=0.100 bearing=0.0 quat: x=... y=... z=... w=...
  5. Note the quaternion values just BEFORE the flip (at pitch=0.01 or 0.001)
  6. Share those values with me

  Then do the same test at bearing=90, 180, 270.

  This will tell us exactly what quaternion lookAt() produces when it's working correctly, so we can replicate
  it at pitch=0.
